# Guess That Theme Song

Guess That Theme Song is a sample Android app by me where players guess a TV show theme song through multiple choice answers after a portion of it is played.
Questions are timed and if the player runs out of time they get the question wrong.

Here is the main screen followed by the introductory screen:
